Version: Windows v7.1 SDK

Building
CMake v2.8.11 or higher is required. To create project files, run the command:
$ cmake path/to/webmlive/third_party/directshow

CMake will generate project (or makefiles, depending on the generator). CMake
will attempt to find the latest version of Microsoft Visual Studio installed
on the system.
